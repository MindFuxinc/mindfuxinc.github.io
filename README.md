As I pivot into the cybersecurity domain, I'll document my journey to becoming a penetration tester(or whatever serenades me in the end). 
The plan is to document 5 cybersecurity projects 
1. Set up an Active Directory environment for pen-testing.
2. Set up a working SIEM in Azure
3. Build a simple rest API
4. set up a Malware analysis lab
5. Identify and remediate vulnerabilities - Network ER
